IMPORTANT NOTICE – PLEASE READ AND AGREE BEFORE USING NVIDIA SOFTWARE OFFERINGS.
This NVIDIA Software License Agreement is entered into between the entity you represent, or, if you do not designate an entity, you individually (“Customer”), and NVIDIA Corporation (“NVIDIA”) and governs the use of the Software Offerings. This NVIDIA Software License Agreement consists of the terms and conditions below and all documents attached to or referenced in this NVIDIA Software License Agreement (together, the “Agreement”). Key terms are defined in Section 17. Customer and NVIDIA are each a “party” and collectively the “parties.”

By registering to use or using the Software Offerings, Customer is affirming that it has read the Agreement and agrees to its terms. If Customer does not have the required authority to enter into the Agreement or if it does not accept all Agreement terms and conditions, Customer should not register to use or use the Software Offerings.

LICENSE

Grant. Subject to the terms of the Agreement, Customer’s Order Form and license parameters of an Enterprise Product Part Number, and payment of applicable fees, NVIDIA grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as expressly granted in the Agreement) license during the Term to install, use and reproduce the Software.

Limited Grants. The grants in Section 1.1 above are further limited as follows:

Users that receive an Enterprise Product identified as “not for resale” or “NFR” (typically a license to a distributor or reseller) may exercise the grants in Section 1.1 solely for internal evaluation or to demonstrate the Enterprise Product to others, but may not use, distribute or deploy in production.

Users that receive an Enterprise Product for trial may exercise the grants in Section 1.1 solely for the trial period.

Authorized Users. Under the Agreement, Customer Personnel may access and use the Software Offerings and Persons may access and use Customer Products. As between NVIDIA and Customer, Customer is responsible for supporting the use of Customer Products. Customer is responsible for the compliance with the terms of the Agreement. Any act or omission that if committed by Customer would constitute a breach of the Agreement will be deemed to constitute a breach of the Agreement if committed by Customer’s Authorized Users.

License Types. The terms in this Section 1.4 apply only to Enterprise Products, not to Community Products. The license types below describe features that may be part of an Enterprise Product; and not all license types may be available for each Enterprise Product. Enterprise Products are licensed under the following license types: Subscription per CPU Socket, Subscription per GPU, Subscription per Node, Subscription per CCU, Subscription per HCA, Usage Based Subscription, or Perpetual license. Once Customer transitions from a Community Product to an Enterprise Product version under a paid Subscription or Perpetual license, any Customer use of such Enterprise Product must be under a paid Subscription or Perpetual license. Customer’s order, license key or the product description will indicate the parameters of Customer’s license.

Replacement Products. NVIDIA may, from time to time at its discretion, give Customer the option to replace a certain Enterprise Product, subject to payment of applicable fees. In such cases, Customer must discontinue use of the replaced Enterprise Product timely upon the start of use of the replacement Enterprise Product. If requested in writing by NVIDIA, Customer will provide a written certificate signed by an authorized officer affirming Customer’s compliance with the replacement terms.

Promotional Offerings. NVIDIA may, from time to time, offer free or discounted pricing programs covering certain uses of Software Offerings, for example having different license parameters or fees for evaluation or academic use. NVIDIA may stop accepting new sign-ups or discontinue a promotional offering at any time. Standard charges will apply after a promotional offering ends or if Customer exceeds the promotional offering use terms. Customer must comply with any additional terms, restrictions, or limitations (e.g., limitations on the total amount of usage) for a promotional offering as described in the corresponding offer terms.

AI ETHICS. Use of the Software Offerings under the Agreement must be consistent with NVIDIA’s Trustworthy AI terms at https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/agreements/trustworthy-ai/terms/.

PRE-RELEASE VERSIONS AND FEATURES. NVIDIA will clearly designate Software versions that are in Pre-Release. Pre-Release versions may not be fully functional, may contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and reliability standards relative to commercially provided NVIDIA software, materials and services. Use of a Pre-Release version may result in unexpected results, such as loss of use or loss of content. Customer may use a Pre-Release version at Customer’s risk, understanding that such versions are not intended for use in business-critical systems and Customer may stop at Customer’s convenience. NVIDIA may choose to abandon development and terminate the availability of a Pre-Release version at any time without liability. Pre-release versions are provided “AS-IS,” “WITH ALL FAULTS,” and “AS-AVAILABLE,” and are excluded from Enterprise Support.

SERVICES.

General Service Terms. Unless otherwise indicated by NVIDIA in this Agreement or an Order Form, Software Subscriptions include Enterprise Support, Maintenance and Updates. Enterprise Support, Maintenance and Updates may be sold separately for Perpetual licenses. After the expiration of Services, Customer retains the right to use a Perpetual license at the last-supported level subject to the terms of the Agreement. Unless NVIDIA accepts Customer’s request for Enterprise Support, Maintenance and Updates in an Order Form, NVIDIA is under no obligation to provide any Service. Unless Software is provided with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of the applicable Software Offering and governed by the Agreement.

Use of Maintenance and Updates. NVIDIA encourages users to use Maintenance and Updates available to them. Customer’s choice not to deploy Maintenance or Update as they become available may result in issues with operability, compatibility and interoperability and result in the Software in use being non-conforming to later Software documentation.

Maintaining the Authorized Number of Licenses. Customer’s use of Maintenance or Update does not change the number of authorized licenses. Customer agrees to promptly discontinue use of prior versions as necessary to maintain the authorized number of licenses.

Work Out of Scope. Any enhancements or additions to Software beyond Maintenance or Updates are outside of the scope of this Agreement.

Services for NFR, Trial or Developer Program Licenses. NVIDIA is not obligated to provide Services for any free NFR, trial or developer program items, even if identified as Subscription versions, and any Services are provided at NVIDIA’s discretion.

USERNAME AND PASSWORD. Customer is responsible for securely maintaining log-in information for Customer Authorized Users’ use, and for all activities under Customer’s account(s). Customer agrees to notify NVIDIA at enterprisesupport@nvidia.com immediately of any known or suspected security incidents or unauthorized use of Customer’s account(s) or the Software Offering.

COMPONENTS UNDER OTHER LICENSES.

Component Licenses. The Software may include or be distributed with Separate Components. The Separate Components are subject to the applicable OSS Licenses or other license terms, including any proprietary notices, disclaimers, requirements and extended use rights; except that the Agreement will prevail regarding the use of third-party open source software, unless NVIDIA components are provided under an OSS License or a third-party OSS License requires its license terms to prevail.

No License Provided. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it is Customer’s sole responsibility to obtain any additional third-party licenses required to make, have made, use, have used, sell, import, and offer for sale Customer’s products or services that include or incorporate any Separate Components, including, without limitation, audio and/or video encoders and decoders and implementations of technical standards. NVIDIA does not grant to Customer under the Agreement any necessary patent or other rights, including standard essential patent rights, with respect to any Separate Components.

Fees do not include any taxes, duties or similar charges.

Taxes. If NVIDIA is required to pay sales, use, property, value-added or other taxes based on the payments provided under the Agreement and if NVIDIA is required to collect and remit such taxes, then such taxes will be billed to and paid by Customer or Customer’s reseller, unless NVIDIA receives a valid exemption or resale certificate. If Customer is not billed the applicable tax under the Order Form, then it is Customer’s responsibility to properly remit the tax directly to the applicable tax jurisdiction. Further, Customer acknowledges that the payments to NVIDIA under the Agreement will be made in full without reduction for withholding taxes, if applicable. This section will not apply to taxes based on NVIDIA’s net income or payroll taxes.

Overdue Payment. If any payment is overdue from Customer or a reseller, NVIDIA reserves the right to suspend or terminate Subscriptions or Perpetual licenses, in addition to any other remedies it may have, until the payment delinquency is corrected. Payment obligations survive any expiration or termination of the Agreement.
